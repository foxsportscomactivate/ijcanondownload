Finding your Canon printer’s model number is essential for downloading drivers, troubleshooting, or seeking support at `canon.com/ijsetup <https://can.redircoms.com>`_. The model number, such as **PIXMA MG3620** or **MAXIFY MB5420**, is typically printed on the printer or accessible via its settings. This guide provides detailed steps to locate the model number on your Canon printer—whether it’s a PIXMA, MAXIFY, or imageCLASS model—so you can proceed with setup or support efficiently.

Steps to Find Your Canon Printer Model Number
---------------------------------------------

1. **Check the Printer’s Exterior:**  
   Look on the top, front, or side of your Canon printer for a label or sticker displaying the model number (e.g., PIXMA TS9120).

2. **Inspect the Packaging or Manual:**  
   Refer to the original box or user manual; the model number is usually printed on the cover or the specifications page.

3. **Access the Printer’s Menu:**  
   Power on your printer, navigate to the **Settings** or **Information** menu on the LCD screen, and select **Device Information** or **System Info** to view the model number.

4. **Check Connected Software:**  
   Open the Canon printer software or driver installed on your computer, then look under **Printer Properties** or **About** to locate the model information.

5. **Visit Canon’s Website:**  
   Go to `canon.com/ijsetup <https://can.redircoms.com>`_, enter your printer’s serial number, or browse the product list to identify your model.

6. **Locate the Serial Number Label:**  
   Look for a sticker on the back or bottom of the printer. The model number is often printed close to the serial number.

7. **Contact Canon Support:**  
   If you're still unsure, contact Canon Support via `canon.com/ijsetup <https://can.redircoms.com>`_ or call their helpline. Provide your printer’s serial number for faster assistance.

.. note::
   The **model number** is different from the **serial number**. Make sure you’re identifying the model (e.g., PIXMA MG3620) to ensure accurate driver downloads, troubleshooting, and support. Keep the printer powered on when checking settings via the LCD screen.
